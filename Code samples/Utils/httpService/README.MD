# HTTPService

## Overview

I created the `HTTPService` as a comprehensive networking layer for my iOS application. This service encapsulates all HTTP-related operations, providing a clean, consistent, and robust interface for making API requests throughout the app.

## Key Features

1. **Protocol-Oriented Design**: I've defined an `HTTPServiceProtocol` to enable easy mocking in unit tests and to allow for potential alternative implementations in the future.

2. **Type-Safe API**: I've leveraged Swift's generics and the Codable protocol to create a type-safe API that can work with any Codable model, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.

3. **Modern Asynchronous Programming**: I've implemented the service using Swift's async/await paradigm, significantly improving the readability and maintainability of my asynchronous code.

4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: I've designed a detailed error handling system with custom `HTTPError` types for various scenarios, allowing for more precise error management and reporting.

5. **Automatic Token Management**: I've integrated automatic access token refresh and management, handling token expiration gracefully to ensure a smooth user experience.

6. **Flexible Parameter Encoding**: The service supports different parameter encoding methods (JSON, URL) to accommodate various API requirements.

7. **Response Parsing**: I've implemented a `HTTPResponseParser` to handle different response types and validate responses, centralizing this logic for consistency across the app.

8. **Logging and Debugging**: I've added comprehensive logging for errors and warnings, facilitating easier debugging and monitoring of network-related issues.

9. **Request Cancellation**: I've implemented a method to stop all ongoing network requests, which is crucial for managing the app's network usage and user experience during certain scenarios like user logout.

## Technical Highlights

1. **Alamofire Integration**: I've wrapped Alamofire to leverage its powerful networking capabilities while providing a simpler, more tailored API for my specific needs.

2. **MainActor Usage**: I've used the `@MainActor` attribute to ensure certain operations are always performed on the main thread, preventing potential UI-related issues.

3. **Custom Date Decoding**: I've implemented a custom date decoding strategy to handle ISO8601 dates with fractional seconds, ensuring accurate date parsing across my app.

4. **Keychain Integration**: I've integrated with my `KeychainService` for secure storage and retrieval of sensitive data like access tokens.

5. **Extensibility**: My design allows for easy addition of new features or modifications to existing ones, such as adding new parameter encoding types or response handling methods.

This `HTTPService` forms the backbone of my app's networking infrastructure, providing a robust, efficient, and developer-friendly way to interact with my backend services.
